    <section name="Sample Code">

    <p>
        You can check out sample code from the MyBatis repository on Github.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/mybatis/guice/tree/master/src/test/java/org/mybatis/guice/sample">Java code</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/mybatis/guice/tree/master/src/test/resources/org/mybatis/guice/sample">Config files</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Any of the samples can be run with JUnit 4.
  </p>
  <p>
        The sample code shows a typical design where a transactional service gets
        domain objects from a data access layer.
  </p>
  <p>
        The service is composed by an interface <code>FooService.java</code>
        and an implementation <code>FooServiceImpl.java</code>.
        This service is transactional so a transaction is started when its method
        is called and commited when the method ends without throwing a unchecked exception.
        <source><![CDATA[public class FooServiceMapperImpl implements FooService {

    @Inject
    private UserMapper userMapper;

    @Transactional
    public User doSomeBusinessStuff(String userId) {
        return this.userMapper.getUser(userId);
    }

}]]></source>
        Notice that transactional behaviour is configured with the
        <code>@Transactional</code> annotation.
    </p>

    <p>
        This service calls a data access layer built with MyBatis. This layer
        is composed by a MyBatis mapper interface <code>UserMapper.java</code>
        and a DAO composed by its interface <code>UserDao.java</code>
        and its implementation <code>UserDaoImpl.java</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        The database access layer has been implemented using a mapper and a Dao that
        internally uses a <code>SqlSession</code>.</p>

            <thead>

                        a DAO using a managed

                    </td>
